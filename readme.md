### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to outline my skills as a web developer with only a few weeks of leaning with Coder Academy.

The long term purpose of this website will be to show the skills I have learned over the entire course to the rest of the world. It will also give the user a view of what I do outside of work, as well as my accomplishments with my career so far.

### Target Audience

The long term objective is to target this website to employers within and outside of my current organisation, to allow career progression or pivvoting from my current role.
