### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to outline my skills as a web developer with only a few weeks of leaning with Coder Academy.

The long term purpose of this website will be to show the skills I have learned over the entire course to the rest of the world. It will also give the user a view of what I do outside of work, as well as my accomplishments with my career so far.

The long term objective is to target this website to employers within and outside of my current organisation, to allow career progression or pivvoting from my current role.

### Functionality & Features
The main functionality and features of my website are as below:

**Navigation:**
- A simple navigation bar along the top which is consistent accross all pages of the site.
 - **home:** A brief introduction to who I am.
 - **about:** More about who I am, and my goals.
 - **portfolio:** Showing my education/employment and ongoing training. This will be updated as the course progresses.
 - **blog:** Example blog posts which can be updated as the course goes on and time permits.
 - **contact:** Various links to make contact with me (phone number not real).

 **Design:**
 - **Mobile:** I designed this website with a mobile first approach, creating wireframe designs in Figma and then developing it out into the mobile layout.
 - **Desktop:** After completing the mobile layout I went back to Figma and created a Desktop wireframe design before developing it out into the dekstop layout. Whilst creating the Dekstop wireframes after developing the mobile version, I kept in mind the target for desktop whilst developing the mobile version. 
 - **Flexbox:** Flexbox was used extensively throughout this website it allow the ease of transition between mobile and desktop versions.


**Accessibility:**
- A minimalistic colour pallet allowing strong contrast between the background and text colours.
- Alternate text on images allowing identification of images for vision impared or if links break.
- Semantic elements used throughout the entire site allowing easy reading of HTML and CSS files
- Commentary throughout the code to allow further ease of reading and understanding of the layout.

**Components**
- **Nav Bar:** I created the Nav Bar with simplicity in mind to allow easy navigation. I incorporated hover underlining to provide feedback to the user that the text was a link they could navigate to. This is in the semantic 'nav' section of each page and commented in the HTML and CSS files.
- **Home:** The 'Grant' in the top left of the site is a hyperlink to the home page. I incorporated hover transform to again provide feedback to the user that they could select the word to return home. This is in the semantic 'header' section of each page and commented in the HTML and CSS files.
- **Section/Article:** I utilised 'section' and 'article' components in the portfolio and blog pages to allow stilising and responsiveness. Each blog post on the blog page is wrapped in an 'article' tag allowing ease of locating individual posts. These article sections contain an image, date, introduction text as well as a responsive hyperlink to the full article.
- **footer:** I designed the footer section to be static at the bottom of the page, holding it in place if the screen is required to scroll to view further content.
- **top:** I addeed a 'top' button to the bottom left of each page allowing the user to easily navigate back to the top of the page if reading through an article.
